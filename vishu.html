                <h2>Chairman Emeritus, Tata Sons and Tata Group</h2>
                <p><b>Ratan Naval Tata </b> (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist, philanthropist and
                    former chairman of Tata Sons. He was a chairman of the Tata Group from 1990 to 2012, and interim
                    chairman
                    from October 2016 through February 2017. He continues to head its charitable trusts.[2][3] In 2008,
                    he received the Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honour in India, after receiving the
                    Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour in 2000.[4]He is the son of Naval Tata, who was
                    adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group. He graduated from the
                    Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree in architecture.[5] He joined
                    Tata in 1961, where he worked on the shop floor of Tata Steel. He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata as
                    chairman of Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. Under his tenure the Tata Group acquired
                    Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, in an attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric group
                    into a global business. Tata is also one of the largest philanthropists in the world, having donated
                    around 60â€“65% of his income to charity.</p>
